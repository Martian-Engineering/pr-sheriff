(If we later want a single-file binary, we can add that as a separate task.)\n- Testability: typical TS CLI stack (vitest/jest) + strong typing for JSON schemas and CLI options.\n\nNot choosing Python+typer\n- Would introduce a second runtime/toolchain (venv/pipx) and require porting existing JS prototypes, with no clear upside for the current integrations."}}
