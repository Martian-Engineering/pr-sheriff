  "body": "## Description\n\nWhen multiple Telegram bot accounts are configured under `channels.telegram.accounts`, message delivery after a gateway restart is routed through whichever bot connects first, not the bot associated with the originating session.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Configure 3+ Telegram bot accounts (e.g., `agent_a`, `agent_b`, `agent_c`) each bound to a different agent via `bindings`\n2. Have an active session on one account (e.g., `agent_a` → agent `main`)\n3. Apply a config patch that triggers a gateway restart (`config.patch`)\n4. The queued/pending response from the `main` agent is delivered through the wrong bot (e.g., `agent_b`)\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nAfter restart, message delivery should wait until the **correct** Telegram bot account is connected before delivering. The delivery context (session → agent → binding → account) should be fully resolved before any message is sent.\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\n- Bots appear to start in alphabetical order by account key\n- During startup, `sessionKey=unknown` is logged, indicating the session-to-account mapping is not yet resolved\n- The pending response is delivered through whichever bot connects first\n- This causes messages from Agent A to appear in Agent B's Telegram chat with the user\n\n## Evidence from Logs\n\n```\n16:35:14.081 [agent_b] starting provider (@agent_b_bot)\n16:35:14.191 session state: sessionId=<redacted> sessionKey=unknown  ← key not resolved\n16:35:14.511 [agent_a] starting provider (@agent_a_bot)\n16:35:23.100 [message delivered — went through agent_b instead of agent_a]\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nThis is a **data isolation / privacy issue** in multi-agent setups. If agents have different access levels or serve different purposes, messages from one agent appearing in another agent's channel is a trust and privacy breach.\n\n## Root Cause & Fix\n\nSee comment below.\n\n## Environment\n\n- OpenClaw version: 2026.1.24-3\n- OS: macOS 26.2 (arm64)\n- Node: v25.5.0\n- Telegram accounts: 3\n- Agents: 5\n",
