  "body": "## Problem\n\nWhen the gateway is down during a scheduled cron run, the job is silently skipped. On restart, the scheduler just sets `nextRunAtMs` to the next occurrence without executing the missed run or logging that it was skipped.\n\n## Observed behavior\n\n- Gateway down at 8:00 AM when Morning Briefing cron was scheduled\n- Gateway restarts at 1:00 PM  \n- Scheduler sees 8:00 AM has passed, sets next run to tomorrow 8:00 AM\n- No indication the run was missed — `lastStatus` still shows \"ok\" from prior day\n- User sees empty Discord channels and thinks crons are broken\n\n## Expected behavior\n\n**Option A: Catch-up mode** — If a cron scheduled time was missed by < X hours (configurable), run it immediately on startup\n\n**Option B: Missed run logging** — At minimum, log that scheduled runs were skipped during downtime and set `lastStatus: \"skipped\"` with reason\n\n**Option C: Both** — Catch up for time-sensitive jobs, log for all\n\n## Suggested implementation\n\n```yaml\nschedule:\n  kind: cron\n  expr: \"0 8 * * *\"\n  catchUp: true              # Run if missed within window\n  catchUpWindowMs: 3600000   # 1 hour grace period\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers relying on daily briefings, monitors, or time-sensitive scans get no output and no indication why. Debugging requires comparing `lastRunAtMs` timestamps manually to realize runs were skipped.\n\n## Environment\n\n- OpenClaw 2026.2.3-1\n- 22 cron jobs configured\n- Gateway runs as systemd user service",
