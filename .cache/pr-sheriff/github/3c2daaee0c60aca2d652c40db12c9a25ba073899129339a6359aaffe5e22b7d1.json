  "body": "## Description\n\nAfter multiple gateway restarts (e.g., from config patches), cron jobs skip their scheduled run window and set `nextRunAtMs` to the following day, even though the current time has not yet passed the scheduled time.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Have a cron job scheduled for 8:30 AM ET\n2. Apply config patches around 2:00 AM that cause gateway restarts\n3. At 8:39 AM ET (after scheduled time), check cron status\n4. Job shows `lastRun: 1d ago` and `Next: in 24h`\n5. The job did not fire at 8:30 AM\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe job should fire at 8:30 AM as scheduled, or if the window was missed, it should still show the correct next run time (tomorrow 8:30 AM) but ideally catch up.\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nThe job skips today's run entirely. The `nextRunAtMs` is set to tomorrow even though:\n- The job was enabled and scheduled\n- The gateway was running at the scheduled time\n- No errors appear in logs\n\n## Workaround Attempted\n\nToggling `enabled: false` then `enabled: true` does NOT reset the `nextRunAtMs` to recalculate based on current time.\n\n## Logs\n\n```\n# Multiple cron restarts between 01:53 and 02:32 UTC\n{\"2\":\"cron: started\",\"nextWakeAtMs\":1770433200000}\n# Job was scheduled for 13:30 UTC (8:30 AM ET) but never fired\n```\n\n## Environment\n\n- OpenClaw version: 2026.2.2-3\n- OS: Ubuntu Linux\n- Cron job: `30 8 * * * @ America/New_York`\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- #10401 — Periodic cron jobs do not run\n- #10523 — Isolated cron jobs don't schedule",
