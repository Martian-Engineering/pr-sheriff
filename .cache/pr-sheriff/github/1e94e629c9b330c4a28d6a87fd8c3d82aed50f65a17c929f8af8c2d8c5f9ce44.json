    "body": "**Note on 1M context window:** The 1,000,000 token context window matches Anthropic's published specs for Opus 4.6 and is what their model registry reports. However, if this capability is still rolling out or is tier-gated for some API users, you may prefer keeping 200K as the safe default in the forward-compat path and letting users override via their local models.json config.\n\nHappy to adjust the approach if needed — for example, using a more conservative default with a note in the docs, or detecting the actual limit from the API response. Just let us know what fits best for the broader userbase.",
