  "body": "## Summary\n\nFixes #3589\n\nWhen cron jobs fire system events, the heartbeat prompt was being appended to ALL events. This caused agents to treat custom cron events as heartbeats and reply `HEARTBEAT_OK`.\n\n## Changes\n\n- Detect cron events by checking if `reason` starts with `cron:`\n- Check for pending system events when it's a cron event\n- Use empty `Body` for cron events with pending system events (the system event IS the prompt)\n- Set `Provider` to `cron-event` to distinguish from heartbeats\n- Don't skip responses that contain `HEARTBEAT_OK` text for cron events\n\n## Testing\n\nAdded 4 tests covering:\n- Cron events with pending system events don't get heartbeat prompt\n- Cron events without pending system events still get heartbeat prompt (fallback)\n- Cron responses containing `HEARTBEAT_OK` text are still delivered\n- Regular interval heartbeats still work as expected\n\n## Backward Compatibility\n\nPreserves existing behavior for:\n- Regular interval heartbeats (`reason: \"interval\"`)\n- Exec completion events (`reason: \"exec-event\"`)\n- Cron events without pending system events (fallback to heartbeat prompt)\n\n<!-- greptile_comment -->\n\n<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>\n\n<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>\n\nThis PR updates the heartbeat runner to treat cron-triggered wakeups differently from periodic interval heartbeats. Specifically, it detects cron events via a `reason` prefix (`cron:`), peeks pending system events for cron/exec events, and uses the queued system event text directly as the prompt (with `Provider: \"cron-event\"`) instead of appending the standard heartbeat prompt. It also adjusts skip/normalization behavior so cron replies aren’t dropped just because they contain `HEARTBEAT_OK`.\n\nTests were added to validate: cron events with pending system events don’t get the heartbeat prompt; cron events without pending system events still fall back to the heartbeat prompt; cron responses containing `HEARTBEAT_OK` are still delivered; and regular interval heartbeats continue to behave as before.\n\n<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>\n\n- This PR is likely safe to merge, with a couple of edge-case semantic concerns around cron detection and multi-event prompting.\n- Core behavior change is localized and covered by focused tests, but cron detection relies on a string prefix and cron system events are concatenated into a single prompt which may have unintended effects if multiple events accumulate. Unable to run tests locally in this environment (pnpm not available), so confidence is moderated.\n- src/infra/heartbeat-runner.ts (cron reason parsing and event-to-prompt semantics)\n\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->",
