That's great! The original, fix (src/cli/cron-cli/shared.ts) is conflict-free and ready to merge.\r\n\r\n   The fix should be solid:\r\n   - Prevents crashes when the job. state isundefined\r\n   - Handles all edge cases gracefully\r\n   - Returns \"unknown\" status for missing state\r\n   - Already has test coverage upstream\r\n\r\n   Ready whenever you are!",
