  "body": "This PR addresses remaining edge cases in cron scheduler reliability following #10776, specifically fixing issues where missed jobs are pushed to the future and dynamic additions suffer from polling delays.\n\n### Problem\n1. **Overdue jobs skipped on restart (#11184)**: While `runMissedJobs` handles the initial catch-up, the current `recomputeNextRuns` logic is too aggressive. It recalculates the `nextRunAtMs` to a future slot before an overdue job has a chance to successfully complete, effectively \"forgetting\" the missed run if it fails once or if the timing window is tight.\n2. **Dynamic addition delay (#11217)**: Newly added jobs with past anchors do not always trigger immediate execution, often waiting for the next minute-level timer tick.\n\n### Changes\n- **State-aware Recomputation**: Modified `computeJobNextRunAtMs` to implement a \"past-due preservation\" policy. If `nextRunAtMs` is in the past and `lastStatus` is not `ok`, the scheduler now preserves the overdue timestamp instead of advancing it.\n- **Failure Backoff**: Introduced a 5-second `FAILED_RETRY_COOLDOWN` to prevent tight infinite retry loops (high CPU) if an overdue job repeatedly fails (e.g., persistent network issues).\n- **Immediate Timer Arming**: Enabled `allowPast` flags during initial scheduling, allowing `armTimer` to detect a `delay <= 0` and fire new jobs immediately upon addition.\n\n### Validation\n- Added regression tests in `src/cron/service.issue-regressions.test.ts` covering:\n    - Overdue job preservation across recomputes.\n    - 0ms execution for dynamically added jobs with past anchors.\n    - Verification of the 5s cooldown window during consecutive failures.\n\n<!-- greptile_comment -->\n\n<h2>Greptile Overview</h2>\n\n<h3>Greptile Summary</h3>\n\nThis change adjusts cron scheduling to better handle missed/overdue runs and reduce delays when adding new jobs:\n- `computeJobNextRunAtMs` now preserves past-due `nextRunAtMs` in some cases and applies a 5s retry cooldown after failures.\n- `computeNextRunAtMs` accepts an `allowPast` option so initial scheduling can return a past timestamp (so timers can fire immediately).\n- Adds regression tests for overdue preservation, immediate scheduling for past anchors, and the failure cooldown behavior.\n\nKey areas touched are `src/cron/schedule.ts` (schedule computations) and `src/cron/service/jobs.ts` (job next-run logic), with new tests in `src/cron/service.issue-regressions.test.ts`.\n\n<h3>Confidence Score: 3/5</h3>\n\n- This PR is likely mergeable, but there are a couple edge cases/tests that should be tightened to avoid regressions.\n- The core intent is clear and the added tests cover the reported issues, but the new `allowPast` behavior for cron expressions can return `nowMs` at exact boundaries (breaking the prior >now invariant), and the regression tests hardcode a store version which can make them brittle across schema bumps.\n- src/cron/schedule.ts, src/cron/service.issue-regressions.test.ts\n\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\n\n<sub>(2/5) Greptile learns from your feedback when you react with thumbs up/down!</sub>\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->",
