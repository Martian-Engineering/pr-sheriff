  "body": "## Summary\nCron jobs scheduled to run BEFORE a gateway restart are not executed in catch-up mode. Instead, their `nextRunAtMs` is recalculated to the next occurrence, effectively skipping that day's run.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Have cron jobs scheduled (e.g., daily at 15:00)\n2. Restart gateway at any time AFTER the scheduled time (e.g., 17:00)\n3. Observe that jobs scheduled for earlier that day (before restart) never run\n4. Check job state - `nextRunAtMs` jumps to next week/day\n\n## Expected Behavior\nJobs should either:\n- Run immediately on restart if their scheduled time has passed\n- Or at minimum, not skip to the next occurrence without any warning\n\n## Actual Behavior\nJobs silently skip their scheduled run. No warning in logs. The scheduler recalculates the next run time based on the new restart time, causing missed executions.\n\n## Environment\n- OpenClaw version: 2026.2.3-1\n- OS: macOS Darwin 24.6.0 (arm64)\n- Node: v22.22.0\n\n## Impact\nCritical for users relying on daily automated tasks (notifications, monitoring, reminders, etc.). Missed runs can go unnoticed until users manually check.\n\n## Workaround\nManual heartbeat checks with tracker files to detect and resend missed jobs. But this is error-prone and adds complexity.\n\n## Suggested Fix\n1. On scheduler init, check if any job's last scheduled time was missed\n2. Either run missed jobs immediately, or log a warning\n3. Consider adding a `catchUp: true` option for jobs that should always run if missed",
