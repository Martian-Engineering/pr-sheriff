There’s no mention here that discovery won’t run at all unless a key/profile exists, even though jan.ai “doesn’t require a real key.” Consider clarifying the requirement as an opt-in toggle and whether jan.ai actually enforces auth on `/v1/models`.\n\n<details><summary>Prompt To Fix With AI</summary>\n\n`````markdown\nThis is a comment left during a code review.\nPath: docs/providers/jan.md\nLine: 9:12\n\nComment:\n[P1] Docs conflict with implementation: discovery is gated on presence of a key/profile.\n\nThis doc says jan.ai auto-discovery happens when you “opt in with `JAN_API_KEY` (or an auth profile)” and omit `models.providers.jan`, but in code `resolveImplicitProviders()` only adds the implicit `jan` provider if it finds an env var name/profile entry (and uses that as an apiKey placeholder).
