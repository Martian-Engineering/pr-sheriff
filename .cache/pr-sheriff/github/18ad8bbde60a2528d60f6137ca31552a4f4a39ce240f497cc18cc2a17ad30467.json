    "body": "Closing this PR after discovering it conflicts with OpenClaw's intentional design for prompt cache stability.\n\nThe test `does NOT include a date or time in the system prompt (cache stability)` fails because including userTime in the system prompt would break Claude's prompt caching, causing:\n- Reduced performance\n- Increased API costs\n- System prompt reprocessing on every request\n\nThe preferred solution (per comments in the test) is gateway-level timestamp injection into messages, not the system prompt.\n\nI'll explore the message-level timestamp approach instead. Thanks for the automated tests catching this! 🙏",
