  "body": "## Summary\n\nWhen the current time was moved from the system prompt to `session_status` for cache efficiency (66eec295b), it created a gap: TUI and web clients don't provide timestamp context to agents.\n\n## The Problem\n\n- Channel plugins (Discord, Telegram, etc.) inject timestamps into messages: `[2026-01-28 18:46 CST] User: hello`\n- TUI and web clients send raw messages without timestamps\n- Frontier models can call `session_status` to get the time, but smaller models (7B, etc.) won't think to do this\n- Result: lesser models have no way to know the current date/time\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nGateway should inject timestamps into incoming user messages when not already present. This:\n\n- Keeps the system prompt cacheable (no per-request time changes)\n- Gives all models timestamp context from the most recent message\n- Requires no changes to individual clients (TUI, web, future clients)\n- Matches existing behavior of channel plugins\n\n## Why Not Just Document `session_status`?\n\nSmaller models struggle with multi-step reasoning (\"I don't know the time → which tool has it → call that tool\"). They need explicit context, not self-serve tools. Injecting timestamps is the same pattern that already works for Discord/Telegram users.\n\n## Related\n\nCloses gap identified in #3652 (closed as intended, but surfaced this edge case).",
