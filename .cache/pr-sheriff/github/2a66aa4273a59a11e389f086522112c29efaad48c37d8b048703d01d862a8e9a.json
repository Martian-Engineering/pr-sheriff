  "body": "## Version\n- OpenClaw: 2026.2.3-1\n- Node: v22.12.0\n- OS: Windows 10 (x64)\n\n## Description\n\nAfter updating to 2026.2.3, the cron scheduler skips jobs without executing them. The `nextWakeAtMs` jumps past scheduled job times, causing jobs to never fire.\n\n## Reproduction\n\n1. Have multiple cron jobs scheduled throughout the day\n2. Gateway running normally\n3. Observe that scheduled jobs don't fire\n4. Check scheduler status — `nextWakeAtMs` is set to a time AFTER several scheduled jobs\n\n## Evidence\n\n**Scheduler status at 11:05 PM on Feb 6:**\n```json\n{\n  \"enabled\": true,\n  \"jobs\": 38,\n  \"nextWakeAtMs\": 1770408000000\n}\n```\n\n**Job that was skipped:**\n- `habit-course-tracker` scheduled for 11:00 PM (cron: `0 23 * * *`)\n- `nextRunAtMs`: 1770399000000 (Feb 6, 11:00 PM)\n- Job never executed — scheduler's `nextWakeAtMs` jumped from earlier time directly to 1:30 AM\n\n**Timeline:**\n- Gateway started: Feb 6, 7:33 PM\n- All crons from Feb 6 missed (morning, afternoon, evening jobs)\n- Scheduler was enabled, jobs were enabled, but nothing fired\n\n## What we tried\n\n1. Changed all 38 crons from `wakeMode: \"next-heartbeat\"` to `wakeMode: \"now\"` — **did not fix**\n2. Verified jobs were enabled and properly configured\n3. Manual `cron run --jobId <id>` returns `{\"ran\": false, \"reason\": \"not-due\"}`\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nScheduler should wake at or before each job's `nextRunAtMs` and execute it.\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nScheduler's `nextWakeAtMs` skips past multiple jobs' scheduled times without executing them.\n\n## Likely Cause\n\nThis started after updating to 2026.2.3. The changelog shows major cron changes:\n- \"Hard-migrate isolated jobs to announce/none delivery\"\n- \"Deliver announce runs directly, honor delivery mode, and respect wakeMode\"\n- \"Reload store data when store file is recreated\"\n\nThe `nextWakeAtMs` calculation logic may have a bug in determining the next wake time.\n\n## Workaround\n\nCurrently none found. Gateway restart doesn't reliably fix it.\n\n## Impact\n\nAll scheduled automation (reminders, accountability calls, nightly builds) stopped working.",
