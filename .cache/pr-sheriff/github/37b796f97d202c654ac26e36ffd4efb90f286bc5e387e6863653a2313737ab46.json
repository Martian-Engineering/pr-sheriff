  "body": "## Problem\n\nThe system prompt currently only injects the timezone:\n\n```\n## Current Date & Time\nTime zone: Europe/London\n```\n\nThis means the agent has to infer the current date from message timestamps (which only show `YYYY-MM-DD` format without the day of week). This leads to the agent confidently stating the wrong day — e.g., saying \"Sunday\" when it's actually Monday.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nInject the full date including day of week into the system prompt, e.g.:\n\n```\n## Current Date & Time\nCurrent: Monday, 26 January 2026, 06:53 GMT\nTime zone: Europe/London\n```\n\nThis would eliminate day-of-week guessing errors entirely.\n\n## Workaround\n\nCurrently working around this by adding a note to AGENTS.md reminding the agent to run `date` before mentioning the day of week — but that's wasteful and easy to forget.\n\n---\n\nReported via Max 🕹️",
