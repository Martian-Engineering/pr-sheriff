  "body": "## Bug Description\n\nAfter a gateway restart (via update or manual restart), the cron scheduler sets `nextWakeAtMs` to an incorrect future time, causing all scheduled jobs between the restart time and the next calculated wake time to be skipped.\n\n## Environment\n\n- **OpenClaw Version:** 2026.2.3-1 (d84eb46)\n- **OS:** macOS (Darwin 25.2.0, arm64)\n- **Node:** v25.4.0\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Have multiple cron jobs scheduled throughout the day (e.g., hourly dispatcher, daily jobs at 02:00, 03:30, 06:00, 07:00)\n2. Update gateway via `gateway(action=\"update.run\")` or manually restart the openclaw process\n3. Check cron status after restart\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nAfter gateway restart, the cron scheduler should:\n1. Recalculate `nextWakeAtMs` based on current time\n2. Find the **next** scheduled job from NOW\n3. Set `nextWakeAtMs` to that job's scheduled time\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nAfter gateway restart at **23:37:53** on Feb 5:\n- Scheduler set `nextWakeAtMs` to **09:00** on Feb 6\n- All jobs scheduled between 00:00 and 09:00 were skipped:\n  - `clickup-dispatcher` (hourly): missed 9 runs (00:00, 01:00, ... 08:00)\n  - `night-learning-mode` (02:00): skipped\n  - `prayer-scheduler-daily` (03:30): skipped\n  - `GuardTrail Security Scan` (06:00): skipped\n  - `morning-digest-combined` (07:00): skipped\n\n## Evidence\n\n```\n# Cron status after restart\n{\n  \"enabled\": true,\n  \"jobs\": 24,\n  \"nextWakeAtMs\": 1770343200000  // Feb 6 09:00 WIB\n}\n\n# Process start time\nThu Feb  5 23:37:53 2026\n\n# Jobs that should have run:\nclickup-dispatcher:\n  Schedule: 0 * * * *\n  Last run: 2026-02-05 23:01\n  Next run: 2026-02-06 09:00  <-- Should be 00:00, not 09:00!\n  Hours since last: 9.8\n  Expected runs missed: ~9\n```\n\n## Workaround\n\nCreated a self-healing cron job that periodically checks for stale jobs and triggers manual recovery.\n\n## Impact\n\n**High** - Critical daily automation jobs (security scans, digests, monitoring) can be silently skipped after any gateway restart, with no automatic recovery or alerting.\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nIn the cron scheduler initialization (after process start):\n1. For each enabled job, calculate the correct `nextRunAtMs` based on `schedule.expr` and current time\n2. Update `nextWakeAtMs` to the minimum of all calculated next run times\n3. Consider adding a \"catch-up\" mode for jobs that should have run during downtime",
