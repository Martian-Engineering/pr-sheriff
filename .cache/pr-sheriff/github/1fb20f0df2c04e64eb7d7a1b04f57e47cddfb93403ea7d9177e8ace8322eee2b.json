  "body": "## Summary\nCron jobs stop executing for long periods (hours+) even though the Gateway process remains up and interactive commands may still work. The internal cron lane appears to wedge behind a job that never reaches a `lane task done: lane=cron` completion.\n\nThis causes **all scheduled digests/alerts to silently stop**, and any cron-based watchdogs also stop (same failure domain). Manual gateway restart clears the condition.\n\n## Environment\n- Host: macOS (arm64)\n- OpenClaw: 2026.2.3-1\n- Gateway mode: local (ws://127.0.0.1:18789)\n\n## What I observe\n- Regular cron jobs (e.g. `telegram-health-check`, `gateway-rpc-health-check`, `notification-audit`, etc.) run normally for a while.\n- Then at some point, a cron session starts processing and the system never logs `lane task done: lane=cron` afterwards.\n- After that moment, **no cron sessions produce transcript activity** for many hours (verified by `~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/*.jsonl` mtimes and a local watcher state file).\n- Gateway restart restores cron execution.\n\n## Evidence (log excerpts)\nCaptured from an incident bundle created on the host:\n\n### Last known activity\nFrom my local state file (`cron-scheduler-watch.json`):\n- `lastSeenActivityEpoch`: **1770309855** (Feb 5, 2026 ~08:44 PT)\n\n### Cron lane dequeues a job and then stops completing\nFrom `incident-20260205-084413.log` around **2026-02-05T16:44:00Z**:\n- `lane enqueue: lane=session:agent:main:cron:5eb4a3da-... queueSize=1`\n- `lane dequeue: lane=session:agent:main:cron:5eb4a3da-...`\n- `lane enqueue: lane=cron queueSize=1`\n- `lane dequeue: lane=cron ...`\n- `embedded run start: runId=acc80e6c-... sessionId=acc80e6c-...`\n\nAfter that point, there is **no** subsequent `lane task done: lane=cron` entry in that capture.\n\n(For context, earlier in the same capture there are multiple successful `lane task done: lane=cron` lines, e.g. at 16:30, 16:32, 16:34, 16:35, 16:42Z.)\n\n## Impact\n- Missed scheduled digests and alerting (e.g. daily suggestions digest, Reddit digest, etc.)\n- Cron-based watchdogs cannot detect/recover because they also stop when cron is wedged.\n\n## Workaround\nI installed an out-of-band watchdog (macOS LaunchAgent) that runs every 5 minutes:\n- Checks for recent cron transcript activity.\n- If stale, captures an incident bundle and mutex-restarts the gateway.\n\nThis reduces user-visible downtime but is obviously not ideal.\n\n## Request\n1. Any known issue/duplicate for **cron lane wedging** specifically?\n2. Can cron execution be protected with per-job timeouts / cancellation so one stuck job cannot wedge the entire scheduler?\n3. Any recommended debug flags to capture where the cron worker is blocked (e.g. stuck `exec`, stuck gateway admin request, stuck model call)?\n\nIf maintainers want, I can attach the full incident bundle(s) (they contain redacted config summaries and gateway logs).\n",
