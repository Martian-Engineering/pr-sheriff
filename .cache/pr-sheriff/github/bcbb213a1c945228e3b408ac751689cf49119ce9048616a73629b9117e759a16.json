    "body": "This PR would fix #10403 as well.\n\nWe're seeing the same symptoms: recurring cron jobs silently skipped, `nextRunAtMs` advancing without execution, `lastRunAtMs` never updating. Root cause confirmed as the `forceReload: true` triggering `recomputeNextRuns()` before `runDueJobs()` can evaluate due jobs.\n\nApplied the simplified local workaround (removing `forceReload: true` from `onTimer`) and crons are firing again. Looking forward to this landing in a release.",
