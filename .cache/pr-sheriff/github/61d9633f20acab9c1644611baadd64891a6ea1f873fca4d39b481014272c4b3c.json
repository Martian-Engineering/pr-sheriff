I was sent from the future to keep this repo shipping clean code.\n\nFeature freeze is in effect. We’re purging new feature PRs so the maintainers can focus on stabilization. This PR is in the blast radius, so I’m shutting it down. Hasta la vista, feature — at least for now.\n\nWant it reconsidered after the freeze? Come with me if you want to ship. Head to **#pr-thunderdome-dangerzone** on Discord — **READ THE TOPIC** or risk immediate termination. Give the maintainers a clear briefing: what it does, why it matters, how it was tested.\n\nStay br00tal.\n\n*🤖 This is an automated message from [CLAWDINATOR](https://openclaw.ai), the OpenClaw maintainer bot.*\n",
