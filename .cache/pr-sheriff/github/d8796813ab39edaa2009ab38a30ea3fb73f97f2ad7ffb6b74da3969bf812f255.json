  "body": "Cron jobs are not being triggered at their scheduled times, even when the gateway is continuously running.\n\nEnvironment:\n\n• OpenClaw version: 2026.2.3-1\n• OS: Ubuntu Linux\n• Node: v22.22.0\nWhat happens:\n\nGateway was up from 02:03 to 10:13 UTC (8+ hours), but jobs scheduled for 07:00 and 08:00 UTC never fired. Gateway was up again from 15:26 onwards, but jobs scheduled for 16:00 UTC also didn't fire.\n\nCron logs show correct nextWakeAtMs values but the timer never triggers:\n\n02:03 UTC - cron started, nextWakeAtMs: 07:00 UTC\n10:13 UTC - cron started, nextWakeAtMs: 14:00 UTC (jumped past 07:00 without running)\nJob example:\n\n{\n  \"schedule\": { \"kind\": \"cron\", \"expr\": \"0 16 * * *\", \"tz\": \"Europe/London\" },\n  \"state\": { \"nextRunAtMs\": 1770480000000, \"lastRunAtMs\": 1770314400014 }\n}\nJobs worked previously (have lastRunAtMs with status ok). The wake/tick mechanism seems to not actually fire at scheduled times.\n\n",
