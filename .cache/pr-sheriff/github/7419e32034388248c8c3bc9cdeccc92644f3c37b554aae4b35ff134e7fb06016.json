  "body": "## Summary\nCron jobs using `kind: \"cron\"` with cron expressions (e.g., `\"0 10 * * *\"`) do not automatically fire at their scheduled time. However, jobs using `kind: \"every\"` (interval-based) work correctly.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Create a cron job with `kind: \"cron\"` and a cron expression:\n```json\n{\n  \"schedule\": {\n    \"kind\": \"cron\",\n    \"expr\": \"0 10 * * *\",\n    \"tz\": \"Europe/London\"\n  }\n}\n```\n2. Wait for the scheduled time to pass\n3. Check `cron runs` — no runs recorded\n4. Check job state — `nextRunAtMs` has jumped to the next day\n\n## Expected Behavior\nThe job should fire at the scheduled cron time (e.g., 10:00 daily).\n\n## Actual Behavior\n- The job never fires automatically\n- `nextRunAtMs` keeps advancing without any actual run\n- `cron runs` shows empty entries\n\n## Workaround\n- Using `openclaw cron run <jobId> --force` from CLI works\n- Converting to `kind: \"every\"` with `everyMs` and `anchorMs` works\n\n## Evidence\n- Job with `kind: \"every\"` (Twitter Monitor, hourly) fires correctly and shows `lastRunAtMs`, `lastStatus: \"ok\"`\n- Job with `kind: \"cron\"` (Daily Email Digest) never fires, no `lastRunAtMs` until manually forced\n\n## Environment\n- OpenClaw version: 2026.2.3-1\n- OS: Linux (Ubuntu)\n- Gateway running continuously (no sleep/restarts during test window)\n- `OPENCLAW_SKIP_CRON` not set\n- Timezone explicitly set in job config\n\n## Additional Context\nThis was discovered while trying to schedule a daily email digest at 10:00 AM. The job was updated at 09:32, should have fired at 10:00 (28 min later), but `nextRunAtMs` was set to the following day instead. Even after disable/re-enable cycle and setting schedule to 10:15 (7 min in future), the job did not fire and `nextRunAtMs` again jumped to the next day.",
