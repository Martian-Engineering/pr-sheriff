  "body": "## Bug Description\n\nWhen switching models via the webchat UI (e.g. `/model opus`), the gateway receives **two SIGUSR1 signals** in rapid succession (~2 seconds apart), causing a double restart. During this window, the webchat WebSocket disconnects twice and in-flight assistant responses can be silently lost.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Open webchat UI\n2. Switch model (e.g. from sonnet to opus via `config.apply`)\n3. Observe gateway logs\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nSingle clean restart: config.apply → SIGUSR1 → restart → webchat reconnects → stable.\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nDouble restart:\n- `config.apply` at T+0 triggers reload detection → SIGUSR1 #1\n- Gateway restarts, webchat disconnects (`code=1012 reason=service restart`)\n- Gateway comes back up at T+1s\n- **Second SIGUSR1** at T+2s triggers another restart\n- Webchat disconnects again, reconnects again\n- Any assistant response in flight during this window is lost (appears as if the agent \"crashed out\" or the message never arrived)\n\n## Relevant Log Excerpt\n\n```\n2026-02-04T21:25:32.084Z [ws] config.apply 104ms\n2026-02-04T21:25:32.578Z [reload] config change detected; evaluating reload\n2026-02-04T21:25:32.620Z [gateway] signal SIGUSR1 received\n2026-02-04T21:25:32.624Z [gateway] received SIGUSR1; restarting\n2026-02-04T21:25:32.724Z [ws] webchat disconnected code=1012 reason=service restart\n2026-02-04T21:25:33.015Z [gateway] agent model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-5\n2026-02-04T21:25:33.015Z [gateway] listening on ws://127.0.0.1:18789\n2026-02-04T21:25:34.023Z [ws] webchat connected\n2026-02-04T21:25:34.153Z [gateway] signal SIGUSR1 received       ← SECOND signal\n2026-02-04T21:25:34.154Z [gateway] received SIGUSR1; restarting  ← SECOND restart\n2026-02-04T21:25:35.615Z [ws] webchat disconnected code=1012 reason=service restart\n2026-02-04T21:25:35.640Z [gateway] agent model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-5\n2026-02-04T21:25:36.449Z [ws] webchat connected                  ← finally stable\n```\n\n## Additional Context\n\n- Also seeing: `Config was last written by a newer OpenClaw (2026.2.1); current version is 0.0.0` — possible version detection issue contributing to the double-fire.\n- The `config.apply` RPC itself appears to both (a) send SIGUSR1 directly and (b) trigger the file-watcher reload path, which sends a second SIGUSR1. Likely needs deduplication or a debounce window.\n- macOS (Darwin arm64), Node v25.5.0, OpenClaw installed via npm\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nDebounce SIGUSR1 handling — if a restart is already in progress or was initiated within the last N seconds, ignore subsequent signals. Alternatively, ensure `config.apply` only triggers restart through one path (either the direct signal OR the file-watcher, not both).",
