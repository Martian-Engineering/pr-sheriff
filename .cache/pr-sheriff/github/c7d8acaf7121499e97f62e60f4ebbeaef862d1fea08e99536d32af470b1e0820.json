  "body": "## Bug Description\n\nWhen the gateway restarts, the cron scheduler incorrectly recalculates `nextRunAtMs` for jobs that already ran earlier that day. Instead of scheduling the next run for tomorrow, it skips a day.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Have a cron job scheduled for daily at 07:00 (e.g., `0 7 * * *`)\n2. Let the job run successfully at 07:00 on Day 1\n3. Restart the gateway later on Day 1 (e.g., at 21:22)\n4. Observe that `nextRunAtMs` is now set to Day 3 instead of Day 2\n\n## Evidence\n\n| Event | Timestamp | nextRunAtMs |\n|-------|-----------|-------------|\n| Job runs successfully | Feb 6, 07:00 | Set to Feb 7, 07:00 ✅ |\n| Gateway restarts | Feb 6, 21:22 | — |\n| After restart | — | Changed to Feb 8, 07:00 ❌ |\n\nThe run history shows:\n- `runAtMs`: 1770321600002 (Feb 6, 07:00 AEDT)\n- `nextRunAtMs` in run entry: 1770408000000 (Feb 7, 07:00 AEDT) ✅\n- `nextRunAtMs` in current job state: 1770494400000 (Feb 8, 07:00 AEDT) ❌\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nAfter gateway restart, the scheduler should preserve the correct `nextRunAtMs` or recalculate it correctly as the next occurrence of the cron expression (Feb 7, 07:00).\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nThe scheduler skips a day and sets `nextRunAtMs` to Feb 8 instead of Feb 7.\n\n## Environment\n\n- OpenClaw version: 2026.2.3-1\n- OS: macOS 26.2 (arm64)\n- Node: v25.5.0\n- Cron expression: `0 7 * * *`\n- Timezone: Australia/Melbourne\n\n## Workaround\n\nManual intervention required. Attempted `cron action:update` with patched state, but state appears to be read-only or immediately recalculated.\n\n## Additional Notes\n\nThis bug causes scheduled jobs to miss their expected runs, which is critical for daily automation tasks like morning briefings.",
