    "body": "Thanks for the review! I want to clarify the hot-reload flow:\n\nIn `server-reload-handlers.ts`, channel restarts go through:\n```javascript\nconst restartChannel = async (name) => {\n  await params.stopChannel(name);  // This calls abort.abort()\n  await params.startChannel(name);\n};\n```\n\nAnd `stopChannel()` in `server-channels.ts` does call `abort?.abort()`, which triggers our abort handler and sets `stopState.promise`.\n\nThat said, your point about being more defensive is valid — if there are other code paths that restart the channel without going through `stopChannel()`, those wouldn't be covered. Happy to extend the fix if maintainers prefer that approach.\n\nThe current fix specifically targets the SIGUSR1/config-reload path that was reported in #8140.",
