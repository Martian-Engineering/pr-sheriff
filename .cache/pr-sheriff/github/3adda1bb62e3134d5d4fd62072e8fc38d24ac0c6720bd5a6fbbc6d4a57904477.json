  "body": "We hit a silent cron outage where no jobs finished for ~200 minutes, even though `openclaw cron status --json` stayed enabled and `nextWakeAtMs` kept advancing.\n\n## Symptom\n- Fleet-wide largest finished-event gap (last 24h in our run logs):\n  - from `2026-02-06T04:49:38.544Z`\n  - to `2026-02-06T08:10:31.957Z`\n  - gap `200.89` minutes\n- During the gap, scheduler remained enabled and wake timestamps advanced, but run logs were not appended.\n\n## Suspected root cause\nIn timer wake path (`onTimer`), the cron store is force-reloaded before due-job evaluation:\n\n- `onTimer` calls `ensureLoaded(state, { forceReload: true })`\n- `ensureLoaded` calls `recomputeNextRuns(state)`\n\nThat recomputes `nextRunAtMs` from current time, so jobs that are due at wake can be pushed forward before `runDueJobs` executes. Repeating this on each wake can defer jobs indefinitely without a hard scheduler error.\n\n## One-line fix\nIn `onTimer`, avoid force reload:\n- from: `await ensureLoaded(state, { forceReload: true });`\n- to: `await ensureLoaded(state);`\n\n## Local confirmation\nApplying that change locally restored cron execution immediately in our environment (new `finished` events resumed for 10m/15m jobs right after restart).\n\n## Environment\n- OpenClaw runtime observed: `2026.2.3-1 (d84eb46)`\n- Install path: Homebrew global install\n\nHappy to provide additional logs or help test a proper upstream patch if useful.\n",
